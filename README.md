Namespace -:

2. kube-system namespace - internal services and pod
3. kube- public namespace - resources available for public

kubectl create namespace <name>
Assign quota resources to namespace

## Imperative vs Declarative approaches
    1.Imperative -: Step by step instruction 
        -   kubectl create,run,expose,edit,scale - these are imperative commands
        -   These are hard to remember
        -   only available for user session
    2.Declarative -: Just a single instruction
        -   Infrastructure As Code is declarative approaches
        -   kubectl apply -f <definition.yml file>
        -   

  While you would be working mostly the declarative way â€“ using definition files, imperative commands can help in getting one time tasks done quickly, as well as generate a definition template easily. This would help save considerable amount of time during your exams.
